    <p>India Tourism Data Analysis Project Report<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Summary:<br />
        This data analysis report presents insights into India's tourism industry using Python. The<br />
        analysis was conducted on a comprehensive dataset that captured various aspects of<br />
        tourism in India. By applying data analysis techniques, we gained valuable insights into the<br />
        contribution of tourism to India's economy, employment, and the popularity of different tourist<br />
        destinations across the country. The report highlights the significant role of tourism in India's<br />
        GDP and employment, emphasising its importance as a key economic sector. Additionally,<br />
        the analysis showcases the diverse attractions that India offers, ranging from wildlife safaris<br />
        and nature-seeking spots to historical landmarks and spiritual destinations. The findings of<br />
        this report provide valuable information for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders to<br />
        make informed decisions and develop strategies to further enhance India's tourism industry.<br />

        &#9679; Methodology<br />
        &#9679; Key Findings<br />
        &#9679; Conclusion<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Methodology:<br /><br />
        To conduct this data analysis, a systematic approach was followed to ensure accuracy and<br />
        reliability in the findings. The methodology encompassed the following steps:<br />
        1. Data Collection: The data obtained from data.gov.in . We are using 8 different data<br />
        sets which include statistical data about foreign tourist arrivals in India from 1981 to<br />
        2020, statistics of FTA distribution in India by age from 2001 to 2019 in percentage,<br />
        quarterly distribution statistics of the percentage of foreign tourists visiting India from<br />
        2001 to 2019, comparisons between world tourism and Indian tourism with world<br />
        rankings from 2001 to 2021, statistics of ITAs in India in 2019 This dataset includes<br />
        the percentage distribution of international tourist visits to India by specific factors<br />
        grouped by countries (also regions), statistics of the number of Domestic and foreign<br />
        tourists to popular monuments in India during 2019,2020 and 2021 along with their<br />
        regions, statistics of the contribution to the share market of Indian tourism in<br />
        percentages from 2017 to 2019, statistics of domestic and foreign tourists visiting<br />
        India in 2019 and 2020 per state.<br />
        2. Data Preprocessing: Before analysis, the collected data underwent preprocessing<br />
        steps to ensure its quality and consistency. This involved cleaning the data by<br />
        removing duplicates, handling missing values, and resolving any inconsistencies or<br />
        errors, reshaping the data, renaming the index, dropping columns, combining data,<br />
        parsing the dataframe.<br />
        3. Statistical &amp; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis data Analysis<br />
        was conducted to present numerical data to uncover patterns, relationships, and<br />
        trends. It involves applying statistical methods and techniques to draw meaningful<br />
        conclusions and make informed decisions based on the data. Exploratory Data<br />
        Analysis was conducted to gain a preliminary understanding of the data. Descriptive<br />
        statistics,Visualisation technique plotting including measures of central tendency and<br />
        dispersion, were calculated to summarise the data.<br />
        4. Reporting: The findings, insights, and recommendations were compiled into a<br />
        comprehensive data analysis report. The report presented the analysis results in a<br />
        clear and organised manner using visualisations, tables, and concise explanations.<br />
        <br /><br /> Key Findings-<br /><br />
        I have analysed how tourism has been faring in India during all these years and found some<br />
        helpful insights. I have taken eight different aspect to analyse &amp; find insights
        <br />
        <br />A.Statistics of International Tourists to India [1981 - 2020]-<br /><br />

        <img src="dataimages/1.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />

        As we can see from the above multi line graph, there has been a steady increase in the<br />
        number of tourists visiting India until 2020 as COVID-19 restrictions led to a huge blow on<br />
        the Tourism sector. The pandemic has not only jeopardised the growth prospects of the<br />
        sector but also caused a significant economic slump, which the sector would take some time<br />
        to recover from.<br />
        Also, the growth in FTAs in India over the years, viz. 2003 to 2007, 2010, 2014 and 2017<br />
        saw a double-digit positive growth, while there was negative growth in the years 1991, 2001,<br />
        2002 (September 11 attacks i.e 9/11 attacks in U.S and many other factors) and 2009<br />
        (because of the 26/11 attack in Mumbai (Bombay), Maharashtra, India).<br />
        Note: Ministry of tourism initiated compilation and dissemination of arrivals of Non-Resident<br />
        Indians (NRIs) and the Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) since 2014.<br />
        B. Quarterly Distribution of Tourists [2001 - 2019]-<br />
        1. Total Arrivals [2001-2019]:<br />

        <img src="dataimages/2.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        As we can observe from the above bar plot, tourism has been improving in India even if<br />
        there were a few exceptions during certain years.<br />
        2. Quarterly Distribution of FTAs during 2017, 2018 and 2019:<br />
        <img src="dataimages/3.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        As per the pie charts above, we can observe that the number of FTAs In India has been<br />
        highest during the winter season (4th Quarter (Oct-Dec) and 1st Quarter (Jan-Mar)) (best<br />
        season to visit India because of favourable weather and temperature) and has been the<br />
        lowest during the summer season (2nd Quarter (Apr-Jun)) (because of heat) during the<br />
        years 2017, 2018 and 2019.<br />

        3. Average Percentage Distribution of FTAs Quarterly [2001 - 2019]:<br />
        <img src="dataimages/4.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        As per the pie chart, we can observe that on an average, the number of FTAs during the<br />
        winter season has been the highest while it was the least during the summer season from<br />
        2001 to 2019.<br />
        C. Statistics of ITAs to India based on purpose 2019-<br />
        1. Statistics of ITAs to India based on purpose 2019 [Region Wise]:<br />
        <img src="dataimages/5.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        As we can observe from the above area plot, South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh)<br />
        contributes the highest tourist visits to India. While the reason for visiting India from the<br />
        above-mentioned regions is mostly for Leisure Holiday and Recreation, it is the least for<br />
        Medical purposes among the 4 specific reasons.<br />
        Medical tourism in India is doing exceptionally well. India ranks among top 3 medical tourism<br />
        destinations in Asia owing to its low cost of treatment, quality healthcare infrastructure, and<br />
        availability of highly-skilled doctors. During the recovery period, patients can turn to a<br />
        multitude of therapies like Ayurveda, Naturopathy and Yoga. Another major factor that<br />
        makes India a desirable medical tourism destination is the fact that it has English speaking<br />
        doctors, reducing the language barrier for foreign tourists.<br />
        <br />





        2. Tourists to India from Top 5 countries - 2019:<br />
        As we can observe from the above multibar graph, Bangladesh contributes the most to the<br />
        Tourism sector of India. Most visitors from Bangladesh primarily visit India for Leisure.<br />
        According to India's ministry of tourism's 'India Tourism Statistics at a Glance 2021' report,<br />
        Bangladesh accounted for 23.6 percent of overall foreign tourist visits to India. This implies<br />
        that it has been and is currently the primary source of international tourists to India.<br />
        <br />
        <img src="dataimages/6.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        3. Average Distribution of Tourists to India based on the purpose of visit - 2019:<br />
        Thus from the above pie chart, it can be inferred that most tourists visit India primarily for<br />
        leisure.<br /><br />
        <img src="dataimages/7.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />

        Each state in India is famous for different tourist attractions. Different places in India will<br />
        entertain tourists with natural wonders, tranquil places, history and architecture, spirituality<br />
        etc. All these aspire visitors to visit India for a memorable trip and is the perfect destination<br />
        for leisure.<br />
        D. Contribution Statistics to the Share Market of Indian Tourism [2017 - 2019]-<br />
        <br />1. Contribution to the Share Market of Indian Tourism region wise [2017 - 2019]:<br /><br />
        <img src="dataimages/8.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />

        As per the above multi line graph, it is evident that South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh),<br />
        Western Europe (mostly from U.K) and North America (USA and Canada) contribute the<br />
        highest towards the Indian Tourism share market.<br />
        Since 2014, adhering to the definition of International Tourist Arrivals, India has started the<br />
        inclusion of figures of arrivals of Non resident Indians. This has resulted in improvement of<br />
        numbers pertaining to contributions to the Indian Tourism Share Market.<br />
        2. Contribution to the Indian Tourism Share Market country wise [2017 - 2019]:<br />
        From the above pie charts, we can infer that during the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the<br />
        contributions to the Indian Share Market by the Major countries has been constant with<br />
        Bangladesh, U.S.A and U.K. on the lead.<br /><br />

        <img src="dataimages/9.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        E. Tourist segregation based on age [2001 - 2019]-<br /><br />

        1. FTAs segregated based on age [2001 - 2019]:<br />
        <br /> <img src="dataimages/10.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        From the above multi line plot, we can infer that most of the tourists who visited India from<br />
        2001 to 2019 belonged to the age group of late 20s to early 50s. The proportion of FTAs in<br />
        different age groups has not changed much in the last few years. The highest numbers of<br />
        FTAs in India were from the 35-44 years age group (21.0%) followed by the age groups of<br />
        45-54 years and 25-34 years. The lowest number of FTAs occurred in the age-group of<br />
        15-24 and 65 &amp; above (8.7%).<br />

        2. Average %age distribution of Tourists based on age [2001 - 2019]:<br /><br />
        <img src="dataimages/11.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />

        As per the above pie chart, it can be deduced that the highest percentage of tourists visiting<br />
        India are youths and the middle ages. This can be due to the fact that the youngsters aren't<br />
        that well off when it comes to the capital and the senior citizens would prefer to travel to<br />
        places that are relaxing and comfortable or India doesn't end up attracting tourists from<br />
        these age groups.<br />
        As much as the elderly might avoid and refrain; travelling is the perfect resort for them to<br />
        rejuvenate themselves and finally enjoy life the way they want to. Just like kids or the young,<br />
        even they need a vacation for a variety of reasons- the primary one being that it boosts their<br />
        physical, mental, and emotional health. But, Most people feel that the biggest deterrent to<br />
        tourism is lack of infrastructure, Lack of good budget hotels , proper roads as well as<br />
        hygiene and sanitation are problems that put off most would-be travellers to India.<br />
        The youngsters on the other hand could contribute largely to Indian tourism especially<br />
        through education. Although the main purpose of international student mobility is to study, it<br />
        can also be considered a type of tourist activity. India is still not seen by international<br />
        applicants as a destination for education because of its education system which needs a lot<br />
        of improvement. If Indian education does improve and gets recognized by the world, then<br />
        there could be a rise in the international students to India which could indirectly improve the<br />
        contribution by the youngsters to Indian Tourism.<br />
        F. Indian Tourism State Wise Statistics [2019 - 2020]:<br />
        1. Foreign tourists per State/UTs [2019 - 2020]:<br /><br />
        <img src="dataimages/12.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        As per the above horizontal barplot, it can be observed that during the year 2019, Tamil<br />
        Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and others had the highest number of foreign<br />
        tourists to their state. It can also be inferred that significant revenue was derived from<br />
        Tourism in these states. Thus during 2020, due to Covid-19 restrictions, there was an<br />
        enormous decrease in the Tourists which led to a huge blow to the Tourism sector in these<br />
        states.<br />
        Tamil Nadu has the largest tourism industry in India with a percentage share of 21.31% and<br />
        21.86% of domestic and foreign tourist visits in the country. Thus the steep decline in tourist<br />
        traffic in 2020 on the advent of pandemic severely affected the Tourism sector of the state.<br />
        2. Domestic tourists per State/UTs [2019 - 2020]:<br /><br />
        <img src="dataimages/13.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        As per the above horizontal bar graph, it can be observed that during the year 2019, Uttar<br />
        Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and others had the highest number of<br />
        domestic tourists to their state. It can also be inferred that significant revenue was derived<br />
        from Tourism in these states. Thus during 2020, due to Covid-19 restrictions, there was an<br />
        enormous decrease in the Tourists which led to a huge blow to the Tourism sector in these<br />
        states.<br />
        Since domestic tourism is several times larger than international tourism in India, any effect<br />
        on domestic tourism could have a big impact on the Tourism sector overall. Thus in 2020,<br />
        Covid-19 restrictions limited tourism activity which translates into a huge reduction in tourism<br />
        expenditure incurred by all types of tourists&mdash; inbound, domestic, and outbound. Thus there<br />
        was a steep decline in the overall revenue obtained from Tourism, particularly domestic<br />
        tourism.<br />
        In 2019, the state of Uttar Pradesh attracted the most domestic tourists sweeping 23.1% of<br />
        tourist share of India, counting about 53,6 Cr domestic tourists, while international figures too<br />
        were no less encouraging at about 47.5 Lacs. But in 2020, tourist traffic in Uttar Pradesh has<br />
        witnessed a severe blow following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Thus the<br />
        decline in tourist traffic not only hindered tourism but also the revenue and jobs that come<br />
        with it in the state of Uttar Pradesh.<br />
        3. Total tourists per State/UTs [2019 - 2020]:<br />
        Thus from the above bar plot, it can be inferred that overall TamilNadu stood first in the<br />
        Tourism sector followed by Uttar Pradesh during the years 2019 and 2020 and it is the same<br />
        even now.<br /> <br> <img src="dataimages/14.png" width="60%" alt=""><br />
        G. Popular monuments during 2019,2020,2021-<br />
        1. Top 10 Tourism Destinations visited by foreigners 2019:<br /><br /> <img src="dataimages/15.png" width="60%"
            alt=""><br />
        As per the above bar plot, it can be observed that Agra was and is the most popular Tourist<br />
        spot followed by Delhi. This can be due to the fact that Taj Mahal which is India's most<br />
        recognizable iconic monument, is situated in Agra. And it is also to be noted that since Delhi<br />
        is just 200km away from Agra and is also quite famous for its unique monuments, it surely<br />
        piques the interests of many tourists visiting India.<br />
        2. Top 10 Tourism Destinations visited by domestic travellers 2019:<br /><br /> <img src="dataimages/16.png"
            width="60%" alt=""><br />
        A clear pattern similar to the previous graph can be observed in the above bar plot. Agra and<br />
        Delhi are still the most popular tourist destinations even among domestic travellers, while the<br />
        rest of the popular tourist zones which are popular for their heritage or their infrastructure are<br />
        pretty much newer destinations which are not so popular among the foreign tourists.<br />
        3. Top 10 Monuments visited by foreigners 2019:<br /><br /> <img src="dataimages/17.png" width="60%"
            alt=""><br />
        As seen in the popular tourism destinations plot, it is evident from the above bar plot that<br />
        most of the popular monuments visited by the FTAs are situated in Agra and Delhi, famous<br />
        among them being one of the seven wonders of the world 'Taj Mahal'.<br />
        4. Top 10 Monuments visited by domestic travellers 2019:<br /><br /> <img src="dataimages/18.png" width="60%"
            alt=""><br />
        Just like the previous graph, it can be observed in the above bar plot as well that the<br />
        monuments located in Agra and Delhi are popular enough, while it can also be observed that<br />
        certain monuments which are not so popular have surely piqued the interests of the<br />
        domestic travellers.<br />
        It can be observed from these plots that all the popular places that are mentioned here<br />
        mostly belong to North India. But it doesn't mean the other parts of India aren't faring well!<br />
        As we can observe from the popular tourism state plots, it can be concluded that Tamil Nadu<br />
        which is pretty popular for its impressive temples and which receives the highest tourists<br />
        throughout India is a state from the South!, which is also followed by South Indian states<br />
        such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.<br />
        But North-East India lags in tourism as a result of insufficient funds, lack of infrastructure,<br />
        transportation, lack of alternative means of transport, marketing, boundary issues, terror<br />
        effect and permit period. If the government were to take the initiative of developing these<br />
        states, then there would be justice done to the tourism sector of these states. After all, North<br />
        East India is home to some of the most stunning, diverse and unspoilt scenery in India. From<br />
        the snow capped peaks of the soaring Himalayan mountains, to the grassy plains of Assam<br />
        and the steamy forests and majestic waterfalls of Meghalaya &ndash; North East India showcases<br />
        unspoilt nature at its finest!<br />
        H. Position of Indian Tourism in the world [2001 - 2021]-<br /><br /> <img src="dataimages/19.png" width="60%"
            alt=""><br />
        From the above line plot, we can observe that Indian Tourism was improving until 2020 as<br />
        COVID-19 restrictions led to a steep decline in tourism. As NRIs were included in the tourism<br />
        statistics of India ever since 2014, there was a steep increase in the number of tourists to<br />
        India as well as its position w.r.t Tourism in the world.<br />
        Conclusion-<br />
        Indian tourism developed a lot since the year of 2010 as the investment for the domestic<br />
        tourism industry and the foreign tourism industry was increased to a great extent. Many<br />
        other factors like transportation, hotel management system and other necessary tourism<br />
        components got major upgrades.<br />
        Hopefully, India will work towards improving tourism and bring it back to its former glory so it<br />
        can continue to improve from here.
